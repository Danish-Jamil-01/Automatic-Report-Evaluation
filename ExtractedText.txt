Report on Jupiter

Jupiter, the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in our solar system, is a gas giant renowned
for its immense size and captivating features. With a diameter of approximately 143,000
kilometers, it is more than 11 times wider than Earth. Its mass, primarily composed of hydrogen
and helium, is over 300 times that of Earth, making it two and a half times as massive as all the
other planets combined.

‘One of Jupiter's most distinctive features is its Great Red Spot, a massive storm that has been
raging for centuries. This iconic feature, roughly three times the size of Earth, is a high-pressure
system with wind speeds reaching up to 430 kilometers per hour.

Jupiter's atmosphere is adorned with colorful bands of clouds, primarily consisting of ammonia
crystals, sulfur, and other compounds. These bands are created by powerful jet streams that move
in opposite directions, resulting in distinct cloud patterns.

The planet has a diverse system of moons, with over 80 known satellites. The four largest moons
—lo, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto—known as the Galilean moons, were discovered by Galileo
Galilei in 1610 and remain objects of intense scientific interest due to their unique characteristics.

Jupiter plays a crucial role in the dynamics of the solar system, influencing the orbits of nearby
celestial bodies and serving as a protective shield, deflecting many potentially hazardous
asteroids and comets away from Earth's path. Its study continues to provide invaluable insights
into planetary formation, atmospheric dynamics, and the broader processes shaping our solar
system.

In conclusion, Jupiter's sheer size, captivating features, and significant influence on the solar
system make it a fascinating subject of study for astronomers and planetary scientists alike.
